          <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <p>
            Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a
            large bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter
            in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are
            ready to cook.

          <h3>Step 2</h3>
          <p>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
            You can flick water across the surface, and if it beads up and
            sizzles, it's ready.

          <h3>Step 3</h3>
          <p>
            Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or
            fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a
            little lumpy, which is what you want.

          <h3>Step 4</h3>
          <p>
            Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using
            approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on
            the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until
            browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
